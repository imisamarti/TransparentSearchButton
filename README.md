# Stylish Transparent Search Button


I added a transparent button in the style of Bootstrap.

  - Type some Markdown on the left
  - See HTML in the right
  - Magic

# New Features!

  - Awesome little icon

### Tech

In this project I used some basic technology:

* [CSS] - Cascading Style Sheets a must.
* [HTML] - For icon and such.
* [Dillinger] - Markdown language translator.
* [Github] - duh!

### Installation

No need to download, just copy & paste into your project!

### Development

Want to contribute? Great!

Go ahead and make any recomendations and changes, all tech is pretty much basic CSS.

### Todos
